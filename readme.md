My Master's project from University of Tennessee - Knoville.
Labeled Super-Time-Stepping for Advection-Diffusion.
I have multiple models used throughout the project in here.
The paper and presentation cover the more interesting results
that come from using the initial square bump profile.

This current project is a mix of Matlab for computation and
gnuplot for plotting.
